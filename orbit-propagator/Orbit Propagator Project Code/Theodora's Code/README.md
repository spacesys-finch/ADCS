# Theodora's Code for the Orbit Propagator Project

## Files:

1. orbit_from_equations.m - MATLAB function file for plotting orbits using direct equations (Task 1)

2. orbit_from_equations.py - Python function file that returns position and velocity vectors for a satellite using direct equations (Task 1)

3. orbitODE_solver.m - MATLAB function file for plotting orbits by integrating the ODE given by the two-body problem (Task 2)

4. orbitODE_solver.py - Python function file that returns position and velocity vectors for a satellite by integrating the ODE given by the two-body problem (Task 2)

5. plot_orbit.py - Python function file that returns one plot for the satellite's position around the Earth and another plot of the satellite's speed versus time 

6. plot_orbit2.py - Python function file that returns one plot for two satellites' positions around the Earth and another plot of both satellites' speed versus time
