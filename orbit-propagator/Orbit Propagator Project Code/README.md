# Orbit Propagator Project

## Members: Annalisa, Suraj, Marco, Mingde, Theodora, Afrin, Ria

Task 1: use equations to plot orbital trajectory based on orbital parameters

Task 2: use ODE solvers to numerically solve the differential equation given by the two body problem

Task 3: Implement perturbations into the orbit using one of three methods (Encke, Cowell, Gauss)

Task 4: Figure out how to implement the propogator on-board FINCH
